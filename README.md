# Zenpower
Zenpower is Linux kernel driver for reading temperature, voltage(SVI2), current(SVI2) and power(SVI2) for AMD Zen family CPUs.

Fork from https://github.com/ocerman/zenmonitor
Fix not patched issue: https://github.com/ocerman/zenpower/issues/39

Make sure that your Linux kernel have support for your CPUs as Zenpower is using kernel function `amd_smn_read` to read values from SMN. A fallback method (which may or may not work!) will be used when it is detected that kernel function `amd_smn_read` lacks support for your CPU.
For AMD family 17h Model 70h (Ryzen 3000) CPUs you need kernel version 5.3.4 or newer or kernel with this patch: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11043277/

## Installation
You can install this module via dkms.

### Installation commands for Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install dkms git build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ocerman/zenpower.git
cd zenpower
sudo make dkms-install
```

## Module activation
Because zenpower is using same PCI device as k10temp, you have to disable k10temp first.

1. Check if k10temp is active. `lsmod | grep k10temp`
2. Unload k10temp `sudo modprobe -r k10temp`
3. (optional*) blacklist k10temp: `sudo bash -c 'sudo echo -e "\n# replaced with zenpower\nblacklist k10temp" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf'`
4. Activate zenpower `sudo modprobe zenpower`

*If k10temp is not blacklisted, you may have to manually unload k10temp after each restart.

## Sensors monitoring
You can use this app: [zenmonitor](https://github.com/ocerman/zenmonitor), or your favourie sensors monitoring software

## Update instructions
1. Unload zenpower `sudo modprobe -r zenpower`
2. Goto zenpower directory `cd ~/zenpower`
3. Uninstall old version `sudo make dkms-uninstall`
4. Update code from git `git pull`
5. Install new version `sudo make dkms-install`
6. Activate zenpower `sudo modprobe zenpower`

## Help needed
It would be very helpful for me for further development of Zenpower if you can share debug data from zenpower. [Read more](https://github.com/ocerman/zenpower/issues/12)

## Notes
 - Some users reported that a restart is needed after module installation
 - If you are having trouble compiling zenpower under Ubuntu 18.04 (or older) with new upstream kernel, see [#23](https://github.com/ocerman/zenpower/issues/23)
 - The meaning of raw current values from SVI2 telemetry are not standardised so the current/power readings may not be accurate on all systems (depends on the board model).
